Now for the carriage you have a couple of different options. You can either pilum or not. I didn't peel this one because it's organic and one option is if you have a peeler like this one that has the ridges right here, I'll show you what how it works. You see how it just makes little Julian pieces? It's really nice. They're nice and small. I personally don't like a big chunk of carrot. Um, so this works well if you don't have this, let me do a couple more swipes. It's pretty cool how that works when you just go around, rotate your carrot. Now, if you don't have this, I'll show you what you can do with your knife. Cutoff apiece it's you know, because this thing rolls around a lot. It's nice to cut a wedge. So that now you're Carol just sits solid and it's not going to roll around on you. In that piece you cut off. You can just do some real fine cheap chopping on it and get real nice thin pieces. You want your pieces thin, I think. Now let's move on to the cucumber. I like to Peel mine again. This one's organic, but I still. I still want to Peel it, so go ahead and Peel your your cucumber. Now here you know you want them to fit into your rice paper, so you might want to cut this into thirds just to be sure. And then I'm going to cut it in half. And I'm just going to cut very thin pieces. If you don't like the seeds, you can leave those out. It doesn't bother me, so I leave him in. The other option is to use the Peeler like we did with the carrots. It will break it up into small little threads like that if you like that. It just depends on how you want it to be and whatever is easier for you. Now for the lettuce."}]

I will show you. At the end, for keeping this sauerkraut submerged nicely, prefer mentink. I try to cut my cabbage pretty thin because you don't really want huge chunks of sauerkraut. You want to be able to get just just as much sauerkraut as you want and not huge strings. So once I finish slicing it fairly thinly. I'll turn it like this and cut across about three times so all those shreds of cabbage are reasonable length and then just drop them right in the crock here. When you're fermenting the cabbage. You really want it to be completely submerged in water because. The good bacteria are anaerobic. They grow without the presence of oxygen and the bad bacteria that might take over if you're not careful. Require the presence of oxygen, so once everything's in there, you want to make sure you want to make sure it is completely submerged in liquid the fermenting process. And the fermentation process pretty much takes as long as you want it to. You want to leave it for at least a week. Usually I leave it for somewhere between two or three weeks whenever I think, oh hey, I had sauerkraut fermenting around here somewhere. I wonder if it's ready yet. So. There's the cabbage.

And then start squeezing and pressing on the cabbage and in just a few minutes. The cabbage will start releasing liquid. And you will. Your cabbage will take up a lot less space and the liquid usually for me, will almost cover the cabbage. I always have to add a little bit of filtered water. So that it's completely submerged.

You just want to mix this until everything is incorporated. Now I've just got a standard cookie sheet here and I'm going to go ahead and line it with a piece of foil. The reason I use the foil on there is for easy cleanup. I'll have to do is take the meatloaf off of it, the oil away. The cookie sheet is nice and clean, doesn't need to be washed, so I'm just going to take my meat mixture and put that out onto the foil.

I'm going to drizzle about. I don't know tablespoon olive oil on one side, I'm going to flip him over. Alright, so there's olive oil on the bottom. I'm gonna take my cheesy bechamel sauce now. If you don't know where I got that or how that came to be, you gotta watch two clips on the site, the bechamel clip, and then the beginning of the cheese souffle clip, where I added the cheese so it's basically a cheese infused. I used Greer, a cheese infused times scented Bay Channel, and I'm putting a nice thick coding on each of these slices. So that's about a half a Cup of Bashan. Element is spread between 4:00, so.

Lemon juice can use lime juice, even use vinegar. I prefer lemon juice. Watch the seeds though. The seeds aren't very nice. Egg Yolks. Egg Yolks. Are better than egg whites or whole egg dressings. I prefer yolks, their richer thralls safer so I have two in there. It's the only one I have one that's up to you like a little more richness. We're going to have two mustard used over you like this happens to be a grainy Dijon. If you want to use a super hot one that's up to you. If you wanna use a mild one that's up to you as well. Again, it's all about preference issue. Is that a teaspoon there? Now you mix it up. Now you'll notice here I have nothing in here that is a preservative. I have nothing in here that's not the highest of quality ingredients. When you get stuff in bottles, that isn't always the case. Parmesan cheese is only one cheese for this parmigiana reggiano. You can tell it reggiano because it has the Red Channel. Label on the Rhine right in the side there it's very expensive, is about $45.00 a kilo, but that's what it costs and you only use a little. That's probably a maybe a teaspoon to Tablespoon and a half maybe. I don't know $0.85 worth for the entire book. That's there. It's worth using the very, very best of ingredients. So let's recap.

She can blend this through. You're going to just go very, very gently. Don't want to rush. This whole thing though from start to finish, takes about four or five minutes. That's about all. Now. There's my dress. Little taste test. Salty sweet. Fragrant I think needs a little more lemon now, but that's just me. And I think needs a little more garlic. But again, I think. Put that in there at the Micro Planer. Microplane are about 30 bucks available at Zehrs Fortinos rule, King superstores even zellers I think has 'em. They're fantastic tools, chocolate, cheese, garlic, Nutmeg, fantastic stuff so. There's our dressing, creamy and rich I'm going to take half of it out.

When you go to restaurants, what they do is they add too much dressing. I want to have the flavor of the garlic I want to taste the flavor of the lettuce. That's why I'm mixing it up like this. I'm going to add more later, you can. Always add more dressing. You can always add more lettuce. It's hard to take it out. It doesn't work the same way. That's why I'm always very cautious about adding too much dressing in a hurry. So here's your salad. This will keep for oh. The dressing is good for a day or two that's about although there's no preservatives in it. In raw egg yolks, you know you always want to be cautious of those. Even though the eggs encounter of the very, very highest quality. I'm always very cautious, so I would take this. Take our. Lovely dress. Park that out. From scratch, 7 read ingredients available very easily. Ingredients everywhere for every Fortinos Every Loblaws, every Sobeys, every store in the area will always have all the things you need to make this Caesar salad. I think the flavors are incredible.

Or it could be made the United States, but basically what they do is they take the same items like a bacon or take the same thing like a bacon and cure it in salt, where bacon is sometimes smoked. This pancetta is cured insult. You could actually it's great and people always cringe at this. But I'm telling you about it. Takes slice punch at that. A little bit of tomato. Lettuce extra Virgin Olive Oil on a sandwich. It's phenomenal, so if you like it's a Italian version of a belti, but you don't even have to cook it. What we're doing is rendering some of the fat out of the pancetta, which is mostly fetches like Bacon is. And we want to add that to the flavor of what we're going to be making as far as the Penela Vodka. So we get that cooking. We're going to go over here. We're going to get our roasted garlic and add that to it. Now however, you, like your punch at the to be rendered down, some people really like it, crispy like you do bacon. They like that real crispiness. I like to get a little little chewiness from it, 'cause it's going to cook a little bit more as we go now. The other thing that we're going to do what you need to know about it. Sometimes people say to me. Well, I can't find pancetta right. You say that? Guys, I can't find project their great good thanks. So I can't find Francesco. What do I use? Well, don't use bacon unless you like that Smokey flavor. What you want to use is pro shoot though, or pancetta. Those are more similar, but they're both cured items and they both work the same way. So we have shallots added to the dish. Again, I love shouts.

I will let that cook down a little bit. What do you think I so far? Really easy, right? I mean, we really didn't do too much. Again, it's in one pan. This will be enough for two, and I'm going to dark cream. You know our magic cream. That's the magic part of the whole show is how it really brings together some all these flavors around it. Before we made a straight cream sauce and that straight cream sauce was the Alfredo. And now we're going to use it in our penela vodka to just breakdown all the other strong flavors.

I'm going to cut them a little smaller, going to cut them a little bit more because of what you want to make sure is that all of your potatoes are about the same size, so they cook evenly. There's nothing worse than when you have one potato that's perfectly cooked and another piece it's raw, so you want to take the extra time and again, I'm cutting the bigger ones into about 6 pieces. And then the smaller one like this one is really small. So I'm just going to cut it in half 'cause you can see this half. And then when we come in three pieces, it's pretty much the same size. So you want to make sure that you keep that in mind anytime you're cooking potatoes or any vegetable really. 'cause you want to cook evenly. The last of the potatoes now before you turn the water on, you want to make sure that you salt your cooking water, because like you do with pasta, this is the only chance you're going to get to cook. To actually season the potatoes themselves before you go ahead and sees in your final dish. It's super super important. Like if you've ever boiled potatoes with no salt in the water, it tastes bland. They don't have very much flavor to them. Same thing with pasta if you could. If you boil pasta in. Plain water with no salts. They really taste like nothing, so it makes a huge difference. I'm going to do is bring this to a boil. Kind of take the heat down to about similar, so I'm going to look for about 20 minutes or until they are fork tender, which is really important. You don't want this to be at all advent. You want these to be really really soft and tender to get that perfect Mashed potato consistency. And when they are there we will move on to the next step."}]

It's probably going to take four scoops. This is all about two flavor. The miso paste is what flavors the soup. Now, since it's really hot, I'm going to turn the heat off. The Heat is now off and the whole idea right now is to get the miso paste to dissolve into the soup, which basically means constant stirring. Your soup should have a slightly Brown color to it. If it's a light Brown, it might be too light. It might not have enough flavor. You might need to add more miso paste to it. It should have a strong flavor when you taste it. In fact, I recommend tasting your soup after you've dissolved the miso paste into it. I can tell just by looking at it. That's going to need a little bit more miso paste.

Your garden snails are going to be pretty small in comparison to a snail that you're going to get at a restaurant, and so you may have seen in a restaurant snails that are served in their shells. One thing that's important to realize about that is that those snails have been taken out of their shells first. They've been cooked like I'm going to show you, and then they've been put back in their shelves for decoration. It's very difficult to do that with your garden snails because their shells are small, so the technique I'm going to show you is just going to destroy the shell. Annual serve them out of the shells, which is another way you'll see them sometimes anyway, so all I'm going to do is just a crack into the shell with a knife. I happen to use a Chinese chef's knife, but if you use a western chefs knife, that's fine. I'm just going to give him a good crack like this, sort of like an egg, and the shell is going to crack apart an again, kind of like an egg. Going to remove the shell from around the sale should come off pretty easy and here you got. A snail keep the shells away. We're going to rinse those off later. And this is a test is now ready to go. So here I've got my snails with the shells removed. Now the way I showed you how to remove the shells can sometimes leave various small bits of shell on the snails. So you want to do is rinse them one more time and just run your fingers through them. And your fingers will tell you if you feel anything hard or sharp. Control piece of Shell and just try to get it out of there, but it usually comes off pretty well with the rent. And you should be all."}]

You don't need any of that saturated fat to make this really, really delicious. So I think that's it. Try to make it about even. Now this is going to go into the preheated 350 degree oven and the best the safest way to cook it is to know that it's 160 degrees inside. So what I do is I put a thermometer in. This is one of those instant read thermometers. You can test it later on when it's done, but I have one that will continue to read if I put it in the center of the meat like that. And then I put it in my oven and this end stays out to tie on to the show in a second. So this goes into the oven for one hour. At 350 and then I have this. Thermometer that I plug this into, which I don't know if you can see and then that will tell me when it reaches the temperature.

Now the baking soda will just help soften the beam, 'cause we're not going to cook these the next day. The following day you could just leave these out at room temperature, covered. The next day we drain them and then put them on a kitchen towel and dry them off and they're like this. We really want all the ingredients that go into the food processor to be dry because we don't want our mixture to be too moist when we mix it all up. So here are garbanzo beans. Then we're going to take 2 tablespoons of freshly chopped garlic. Now remember when you're choosing garlic, I always like to squeeze it before I buy it. Make sure that it's not porous and that it's not sprouting from the top, and then that will sort of ensure that you're getting very fresh garlic. 1/4 Cup of. Chopped yellow onion this is yellow onion or they call it Brown onion in some grocery stores were going to use 1/4 Cup of chopped parsley, 1/4 Cup of chopped. Um, cilantro and 1/4 Cup of chopped green onion. Now all of these. I rinsed and dried in advance so that they wouldn't be full of moisture. So the first thing to do is put the garbanzo beans.

This is so delicious and when you fry them, they've become crunchy and crispy and then we put a fresh may tahini sauce, which is called a detour. Which is Lemony and garlic and we just eat them.

Now you want to add this just before you're going to make them. The reason is is that the salt is going to start making the moisture drop from the onions, so just before you're about to start making the falafel, shaping them. Whether you're going to fry them or freeze them, it doesn't matter. You want to add this just before. Go ahead and mix this. Now I'm going to show you two different ways to make the falafel patties. If you have a falafel mold which isn't necessary.

Pack on and it's about 2 tablespoons. And you really press it to shape the Falafel. And you make it a little dog shaped. Look at the spring it Springs up. And you just transfer it to your tray and do that again. OK. Just little Dome and how easy you just transfer them to the tray. Now This is why it's important that all the ingredients aren't full of water when you start because you want this to hold together. Now let's say you don't have the falafel mold. You can just take about what's 2 tablespoons. And you just make it into a Patty. And you sort of flatten it between your hands. Now you got it. I just make them a little Dome shaped. There you have. A Falafel Patty and you can make those so with or without. The Falafel mode. You can make these in there and then we're just going to take raw sesame seeds. You don't want to use toasted sesame seeds because they won't stick. They'll stick when you put them on here, but when you go to fry them, they'll come right off and you just take. A little bit and you sprinkle the tops. Of your falafel patties. And just press it down with your finger. OK, we're going to go ahead and make a few more of these.

So I brought it to 375, so we're going to go ahead and fry about four of these four or five of them at a time. The reason we don't want the oil to be too hot is 'cause we really want them to cook all the way through and to get nice and crunchy on the outside. So that the beans will cook through to the inside as well. I think I'm going to go ahead and put it out for him. When you first put them in, just leave them alone. Don't touch them for a couple of minutes. Let them sort of combine together and hold together, and then you can start pushing them around a bit. And once there are nice Golden color, you can remove them. I've double lined up dish with paper towel. I'm going to transfer them to that dish and then we're going to go ahead and dip them into a tahini sauce of the tahini sauce that we've made is. It's also in the book. It's half a Cup of tahini, which is the ground sesame seed. And you take that first, you mash one garlic. Large clove of garlic with salt, using a pistol. Then you add the tahini and half a Cup of tahini. You mix that around and you add 1/3 of a Cup of fresh lemon juice. 1/4 Cup of water and 1/4 Cup of finely chopped parsley and you get. This garlicky, tangy Lemony flavor tahini sauce, which is perfect to dip the falafel into. OK, so now after a couple of minutes we're just going to go ahead. Now I'm using a slotted spoon so that I can take them out in. The oil will drip off and we can put them on my paper towel lined. Dish to observe the rest of the excess oil from then look at that. How beautiful. Their beautiful Golden Brown color and see the sesame seeds. Have stayed on because they were raw. Now if you use toasted. They'll just fall off while you're frying them, so let's go ahead and put another four in, and then we'll try. We'll go ahead and try one of these."}]

Obviously it doesn't need to be. Act here because, well, you're going to come in. Mash them, you just want them smaller so they cook faster an Even so that they cook evenly."}]

Right now, just put in a little bit of coarse salt and then start pounding. Once you pound the crap out of the way, then you start using your hands. It's really a little hard work, but it's also worth it because it let's out some energy and you know we have so much extra energy we have to burn somehow. So why not do it? This way you know 'cause you weren't tired enough from everything else you have to do, but why not the point of what we're doing now is we actually want to release the juices in the cabbage so. You can either punch it like you know, think of someone you're mad at and start punching the cabbage or just start squeezing it. You know, I think it's something you really want to squeeze. The ones. I'm just joking, but either way you want to get as much juice out of there as possible, because if you want sour cap should be good. You want the cabbage juice to be the most of them, liquid of the sauerkraut and not water. I've actually made sauerkraut, both without pounding it end with handing it. And when you pound it, it actually it spoiled less quickly, whereas when you don't pound it, it could sometimes spoil faster. You see I finished pounding it and squeezing it and see how much liquid is here at the bottom. That's a liquid that you want to have. At this point, you actually want to tasting it. No need more shot the way you know how we need more short or not. If you wanted to be salty but not too salty that it makes you grossed out because you want to have salt in it to stop the bad bacteria from growing. But if you have too much salt in it and the good bacteria can grow either so you want to add enough salt so it is kind of like Pickles, but not way too salty that it's unpalatable. So there's exact measurements for how much salt you could should add, but I usually just do it the case now that I finished adding the salt and I tasted it to make sure it's the right saltiness. And you could add other spices if you want the traditional European ways to add Caraway seeds and mustard, or some people add Bay leaf if you want to make it more Asian inspired, you could add some ginger and garlic and scallions and hot Peppers."}]

All three of these potatoes were just over a pound each, which means once I true, I'm going to have about 3 pounds of potatoes to work with, which is going to make about 8 generous portions. And then once those are peeled, we're going to quarter them. And to do that will cut it in half. And by the way, the potato tapers a little bit. Always cut the tapered end a little longer. See that I didn't go exactly in half right. That will compensate a little bit for the difference in Girth, so we'll cut him in half, will cut those halves in half, and that's a pretty good method for getting even size pieces. By the way, in our original Mashed potato video, we cut him in half lengthwise, but we've updated and then once those potatoes."}]

This salt in I usually like give it a bit of a massage and then leave it for a little while like a few minutes and have a rest and do something else just so I don't get too bored with it and I pull out any big chunks like that. Massageing, so yeah, I'll just keep him outside for another few minutes and then let it rest. For five minutes or so. Will come back to it."}]

I've actually found what I've made it with less salt. You know the flavor end up being a little dirty and I didn't enjoy it as much, so it's a personal preference. Things you know, just play around. Do we want to put it into the jar and really press it down really hard? And that is what we want to do is actually draw moisture out of the crowd and. Because we actually want the fermentation to happen under liquid and you're not going to believe this when you start taking into the job. So I think you know it's never going to get enough sleep with her heart and in the end it always does. So I'm just going to pack in. Just keep packing. Actually probably easier with my hand just squishing down. Be brutal and you'll start to see the liquid coming. I've got all that cabbage packed into the jar and he wouldn't believe it. Hey, like all that cabbage in the bowl has packed into a jar. You only have a feeling about half a jar. Surprises me every time I do it, so I've just spent a few minutes really tracking it down with my hand with a spoon, and hopefully you'll be able to say that there's a fair bit of liquid in there. It's not, it's more, and more is coming out with time and like it takes a little while. And well, sometimes what I do is packing it in, and I'm not getting the liquid. I just let it sit for five minutes and walk away from it. And then you come back to it and it let this salt draw the liquid out of this verbal in the background. Telling us this story. So what we liquids really important? Because the fermentation has to be has to happen under under the liquid in anaerobic environments. If its editor, the lactic acid bacteria can't do their things, so just keep pushing down with his brain and if you get really frustrated and you finally not getting the liquid out, you can always just chop it up with a little bit of water. But the problem with water is it's going to dilute the flavor of the sauerkraut, but sometimes you get to a point where you just go. I couldn't be bothered, so that's looking pretty good to me. So well, we're going, so it's not completely submerge, but there's a lot of Fair bit of liquid around."}]

That's really important. If you don't get that, you can really risk making yourself or someone else sick, so be sure to double check with the butcher behind the counter if it is sushi grade now our lovely model here is slicing it nice and thin right from the start using our sashimi hotel and sashimi means basically raw fish and Hocho is the Japanese word for knife. That really does make all the difference in the world. Having a nice sharp knife to work with, especially when you're working with excellent cuts of fish like we have today. So we sliced horizontally or I'm sorry vertically and now we're going back over and trying to get really really small, tiny pieces were going for not quite ground hamburger consistency here because you know, for those of you fans out there for spicy tuna rolls like myself. You know, we get the really small pieces of fish mixed up with the spicy tuna sauce, so that's what we're doing right now is is getting our sashimi grade or sushi grade piece of fish to those little chunks to mix in with the spicy tuna sauce. Now the Japanese technique here is called to Taki, and that's what you're witnessing right now. I guess chopped is a pretty close translation in English. For that. It certainly is a little bit different technique, but very similar nonetheless. And for those of you really interested in Japanese culture and things like that, you'll notice that on the hotel or knife if you will. There is some engravings on the side, and this knife is from Seki, and that's where the originally made all of the ninja swords and right now that's a major hub for Japanese cutlery as well. In my family and visited there, that's where they make some very fine surgical knives as well. And actually feather brand, who makes shaving things for men. His base there as well some excellent knives. Anything with a blade that comes out of that city is just ridiculously sharp, and that's the knife that we're using today as well. And I can't stress enough they having a nice sharp knife working with these kinds of meats really makes all the difference in the world and pictures worth 1000 words. So my has been demonstrating the tacky method here. Certainly be careful with your fingers, you don't want to cut yourself and just going back and forth over the meat like so. To get it to the almost hamburger consistency is what we're aiming for, and I think we're getting pretty close. You know, just going back and forth back and forth over the meat is really what you need to do so. There we are really bunching it together. And there we go. Probably one more pass, possibly to to get us there. And there we go, so seemed to couple minutes, but that's the consistent we want."}]

If you don't know how to make this sauce, please see other video. We explain exactly how to mix it together for you guys out there. Now it gets a little tricky. You'll notice my eyes kind of slicing the meat with a spoon to mix in the spicy tuna sauce. When you get the meat in this consistency, it's not exactly the easiest to mix and sauces with, but you just kind of rub it together and mix it around. It does take help minutes, but definitely you want to be gentle with your meat at this point, even though we just chopped it up. Really really small pieces, but you don't want to match it anymore than that. So just be gentle with it. Mixed around. It might take a couple minutes, but you can certainly get it to where you want it to be, and there's no hard and fast rules on your ratios here. It's whatever flavor you want.

You don't want to have the orphan. Sushi pieces on the end that don't have any fish in them, so definitely extended a little bit past the nori or seaweed if you will, and that's really, really important.

That's what you want to look like before we go ahead and roll the pieces together. No, you grab the bamboo mat lifted over enough for it to touch the other side of the sushi and with a firm grip in motion. That's how we really get the sushi to come together. Now you don't want to smash it together. You do want to be firm, but definitely don't want to just mash all the gradients in the middle together. It really is a fine line that comes over time. A little bit of practice and I'm sure you can get it down, so we flipped it over again with the firm gripping motion once again. And the surrender app. Sometimes 6 together. But it's not a problem at all. And there we go, the last trump squeeze a little bit more. You'll see some of the spicy tuna coming out the sides. If you squeeze it so hard that all of it pops out, you definitely know you're gripping too hard. But if it does come out just a little bit like so, that's perfectly normal.

Incredible dividends from Otis air. It's slicing right through, and for those of you who do watch more videos, I want to point out here that we use the rice cooker for the rice that we used on the spicy roll tuna here, and you'll notice that it doesn't clump up. As bad when you cut through it, you'll notice that you get nice clean slices. The flavor of the stove type rice comes out the same but with the rice cooker you can see that's where you really get these neat cause that you can really tell when you're cutting your sushi rolls in particular. So here we are. You know how thick you want your rolls and things like that is really just up to personal preference. It's whatever you like. I think we're cutting him a little bit thinner here, but that's 'cause we have a family and we like to have a lot of pieces of a lot of different flavored sushi.

Garlic is good for your heart so I may add a little more than a teaspoon and a fourth a Cup of lemon juice. And you know you can freeze lemons. Let me tell you a great trick. When you buy lemons in the store and if they're ever on sale. Take your lemon whole unpeeled like this. Put it in the freezer. Let's freeze it hard, uncovered. When it's frozen hard. You've got a frozen lemon. The great thing is thought out and it will exude so much juice because the cellular structure has broken down in the freezer, just like tomatoes, and also if you're going to zest that frozen lemon zest it before. Of course you cut it in half, and while it's still fairly frozen, but that is a great way to have vitamin C all year round. Now. Sometimes when you buy a lemon two at the store there hard and the old fashioned way too as you roll it, roll it, roll it on the counter. With the palm of your hand to start breaking that cellular structure down. If it's still real hard, sometimes that doesn't work well. What you can do is poke a few holes in it like this, take it over to the microwave and microwave it just a few seconds, not long. And what happens is the heat of that microwave will again soften the outside and the inside, and you'll get lots and lots of juice. So that's your lemon primmer for today.
