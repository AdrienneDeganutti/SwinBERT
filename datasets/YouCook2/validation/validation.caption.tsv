It's got a nice simmer going and it's boiling off that water. You're going to notice all the slime from the beef coming to the top.

Once it's boiling and then they're going to rise to the top again when they rise the top, you just want to scrape off the sludge, scrape off the sludge, scrape off the sludge. This this is just me.

Everything else. Everything is going to come nicely together when we shred. It's going to be absolutely yummy. So far we've been doing this for about, I'd say maybe 30 minutes.

And then if you want to change something afterwards, go ahead, but at least try it the way I have it first. Nothing worse than saying I'm going to cut a corner here and there and then saying oh it didn't turn out the way I wanted. Just do it the way it's written and then if you like it, do it again. If you don't like it, change something. Alright, so I'll see you in a bit. So where into our process here? We've been doing it for about maybe an hour. Hour and a half. I just covered up for a little bit, but you don't really have to because the key is to get the reduction going and just take anything that's off the side. Here 'cause that is your flavor and.

To be honest, yellow mustard seems to be more traditional, but I really do like the Dijon better here. So a little bit of mustard. And then we're also going to need some vinegar, and for this I'm recommending plain white distilled vinegar. And it's not like you're going to wreck this using a different vinegar. But really, this is just in here for the acidity, and I think we want something that has a neutral flavor. And then we'll need to season us up a little bit with a shaker. Cayenne pepper as well as some freshly ground black pepper. And of course, some salt. And we'll take a whiskey will mix that up.

Do you choose the answer? You can, yeah. Build 1 and we're going to end up, Dan said he likes this one kind of sauerkraut that has little slices of it little round discs. So I'm going to use this little handy mandolin. And I highly recommend using a glove to protect your fingers. There are ways. There are mandolins that have a little safety of safety guard, but I like to do it this way, so I think that's in the shop. The Dikan by hand if you want to absolutely, you can do all of this by hand. You can just thinly slice everything, but for speed the Cuisinart does wonders cool so everything can be done by hand. Great and so. So what we're about to do is independence. Raw living sauerkraut to make you independent of expensive raw food. So what do we want to do first? I guess I'll show you the. Spanish yeah go ahead. OK so we just kind of take it like that. And you get these little pieces. See. And there's some more perfect ones you can get perfectly round once you get in the swing of it. It gets a lot easier then you make a whole big bowl of those, and I'm not going to do the whole thing while you're watching. We're going to cut this and then come back when all of the pieces are ready to go in the quiz and art is that we're going to do it. Show him the little bit with the cabbage shred the cabbage, show him a little bit of everything, and then we'll take a break and will chop everything up. OK, so this goes back on. So this is the shredding blade. It goes like this. Usually the Escalade goes at the bottom of the Cuisinart and this one sticks. I couldn't figure out what to do with it when I got mine and I finally watched the video on there we go. So it goes like that. Click it, shut and turn it on. So all you wanna do is. This is the part that turns out we have to do this a little bit thinner to fit in. There is actually you can put it down right in there right. There you go. Camera. Test. That's the cabbage we're going to do. The green and the purple and then we can do the same thing with the carrots shimakura. I like to do this part. So to sum it up, what you do is you take everything that you see here and you shred it or chop it in any way that you see fit. Yeah, so, but basically we're going to just run everything through the shredder here, so and then the one important thing that you need is a nice Big Bowl 'cause you're going to put all the ingredients in here and squeeze them and let them sit with the salt so that they have juices and then when it's juicy that's when you can put it into the glass container so we'll get to that part. OK, cool, so we're going to take a little break here. And we're going to shred and chop everything, and then we'll come right back. So stay tuned."}]
/mnt/welles/scratch/datasets/YouCook2/YouCookII/raw_videos/validation/OpURFOTdycE_2.mp4	[{"caption": "take all the shredded vegetables in a bowl add 4 tsp salt and mix well", "asr": "Alright, we're back everybody and what we've done so far is basically decided to shred everything in the Cuisinart, including the Diakon Radish. Because it was going to take a little bit longer to make little mandolin slices, so everything has been shredded. It's beautiful, it's colorful, and now I'm going to add some salt. Probably about four teaspoons and the salts gonna help break it down and get the juices out of the vegetables so that there's enough liquid. So what we're going to do is mix it now with your hands and give it a really good mix. An in about 1/2 an hour. This should be juicy enough so that when we put it into the glass container there will be enough juices from the vegetables to cover the vegetables so you want a little bit of liquid rising above. Which is why we're going to wait it down and push with the plates that the juice and stay on top so it stays moist and the premise is is that the vegetables are going to Ferment and their sugars in the vegetables are going to start digesting themselves so that the digestive enzymes are in play so we don't have to work so hard. Our body doesn't have to use its own digestive enzymes to work to digest it, so it's easy to digest and it's healthy flora. So there you have it, we're going to let this sit and come back to you. Thanks, Steve."}]

Next is that everything has been kind of Marinated in its own juices between the salt and my really squeezing. I got a lot of the liquid out of the vegetables, so now we're ready to put it into this. Just see how much liquid is down in there. Oh, good work. I'm gonna fill it about 3/4 of the way fall. And you want to check it every day, and if there's any foam or any mold you're going to remove it. And depending on the temperature of the room you want to do it, keep it. Store it in a dark kind of not too hot, not too cold room, and in about four days approximately it could be ready and you'll taste it and see if it's our enough for you so you can always leave it to Ferment and longer. And once you're ready, you keep it in it. Sealed glass jar in the refrigerator and it could last for awhile and it's nice you'll have a lot for your family. Some people say you should be eating these things. With every meal probiotics cool. So let me see here. We spend about $10 on vegetables and it's usually $10 for a little jar jar. I'll show you guys a jar if we still have that. Here it is. So this these jars right here are $10. OK so we just made about for $10. We probably made about six of those, so I'm saying so we've got six times our moneys worth by making this sauerkraut ourselves. And we're about 20 minutes into the process from the time that we started. Chopping the vegetables and then we she marinated it here with her hands for about 5 or 8 minutes or so. So it's really not as time consuming as I thought. Very easy and you can. Then you can just eat lots of it and not feel guilty that you're just wasting money. And this helps you to be independent to be able to be a raw foodist and not have to spend so much money. So we're really conscious about giving you some recipes that are affordable and accessible. So I'm placing this late in here. Kay Ann, I'm going to press it down so that the juices cover the vegetables and then you wait it with a clean. A large clean stone or a Mason jar filled with water and it press down. Let everything's really covered with its juices. So we can begin to digest itself. Yeah, and then ideally I think that the jar would be a little bit lower. We could just build it up a little bit less, but you cover it with a towel and then you go and then in about four days it'll smell really funky and would be really good for you, so I hope you enjoyed that. Anything else, Dan."}]

But when you taste it? You don't really taste sour cream. Yeah, it gives it a little bit of that thang that happens with sour cream, though. Zippy stuff, that happens, but I gotta tell you what this does for the cream factor and that Mac and cheese is. It's beyond phenomenal, so that's what we're going to do. A little bit of Omaha SH to my untereiner at that time period, and I'm going to do a little sour cream and it takes me back to some really, really far memories. That's what cooking is about.

The next thing I'm going to do is 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar. You can find this in the Asian section or the ethnic section of the grocery store, or it may be in the vinegar section. Just depends on what store you're at, but really easy to find. Very inexpensive integrate. Ingredient for Asian cooking. The next thing is 2 tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce. I always use the low sodium because soy sauce has a ton of salt in it and I like soy sauce. I don't like to not use very much this way. I can still use 2 tablespoons and not worry too much about the salt content. The next thing I have is a tablespoon of Brown sugar and this is just going to add a little bit of sweetness because most Asian food does have a little bit of sweetness and a hot nishana sourness. It's kind of got all these different flavor components, so we do need. A little bit of that and the Brown sugar is going to be great because it's got a really rich flavor more than just a white sugar would, so we don't have to use quite as much.

Nothing like this is going to happen here, so once you add oil to this will add some whole spices in whole. Spices will be using cinnamon. Gloves and Green Cardamom. Indian preparations or Indian carries are quite flavorful with whole spices as well, and these ingredients impart a lot of flavor to the Curry. But you don't need to add lots of it. Maybe a small piece of Cinnamon, Green Cardamom and some clothes. So."}]
/mnt/welles/scratch/datasets/YouCook2/YouCookII/raw_videos/validation/NRovp9c9e-4_1.mp4	[{"caption": "add grated onion and cook until the onion turns brown", "asr": "Add onion now what happens is after you great onion it kind of leaves water like this, so try and squeeze out this excess water cause if there is water. In the onion, which means it will take awhile to Brown and in the Chicken Curry you need nice Brown onions, so just squeeze out this excess water like this. So when you squeeze out this water, Browning happens faster. And you add it to this oil and you start sorting this till the onion starts Browning. Now sometimes what happens is while 14 jewel observed that the oil has already got absorbed by the onion because initially we had not added a lot of oil, you can easily go on and on with this much oil as well if you are quite calorie conscious. If you think you can easily carry it off by adding some more oil you could add it sure or in this case if you want to make it with very less oil you have to keep on sorting this. Then the onion starts Browning. Once onion starts Browning, we will add the other ingredients. All the other spices shouldn't be added before the onion Browns, because once you've added everything else, onion will not Brown. It'll only stay white. But since we want the onion to Brown, we will not add anything right now. What is basically Browning of onion? Onion has got a lot of sugar and when it comes in contact with heat like this, it's caramelize is. And that is why Brown onions always stay sweet. Since the sugar has got caramelized, it tastes sweet, and it also turns Golden Brown, so that is a very simple logic behind Browning of onions. And of course it also gives a very good flavor to the Curry. Most of the Beriani as you see, have Brown onion as garnish is only because it gives good look at the same time. It also tastes nice and in case of Chicken Curry we have to Brown the onion because in case of onions like this it stays quite raw. It doesn't give a good. Mouth feel, so once you Brown the onions it really gets combined with all the gravy and it doesn't separate from the gravy. You'll always notice if onions are left draw as in if they're not really sorted well, they will always separate us and you'll have a tomato gravy on one side and you have the onions on one side, so it is always important to sorted the onions to an extent that it starts brownie. OK, so you see the onion has already started Browning. Now is the time."}]

Now after you add the whole spices there are chances that it may burn. So you may add very little water. And just mix this. Or is the spices would have all got burned since there was very little oil that we had used in the masala? OK, so now this needs to be sorted for about a minute."}]
/mnt/welles/scratch/datasets/YouCook2/YouCookII/raw_videos/validation/NRovp9c9e-4_4.mp4	[{"caption": "add tomato puree and salt and mix", "asr": "So we have pureed the tomatoes will Add all of it here. You see, offer you add the tomato puree, the color changes and it goes nice and bright red. I mean this case, if the tomatoes were not read this would not have looked very good. It would have given an insipid look and apart from that the red chili powder also that we have used is the Kashmiri One which is not very spicy and it imparts good color. So as far as possible try and use Kashmiri red chili powder and bright red tomatoes. So this way you will have a very good nice bright Red Chicken Curry. Now after we've added the tomatoes will now add salt. Salt should also be added soon after the tomatoes, because that way the tomatoes cook faster because once we add salt to tomatoes, it automatically leaves all the moisture and once all the moisture in the tomato is evaporated, the tomatoes are done. So here the actual cooking happens where the tomatoes have to cook, as in tomatoes if they are left."}]

In that case the Chicken Curry will go quite salty and right now will add some coriander as well. 'cause fresh coriander when you added in the gravy. It imparts very good flavor. So after this just makes this nicely. Now don't add any water right now because chicken also has a lot of moisture in it and it will also leave all the moisture in giving the Curry the required consistency. So just mixed is in like this will add some garam masala powder. Yeah this is available in most of the grocery stores. Once again will mix this if needed. Will add water but that will be towards the end and water whatever that you add to the Curry will have to be hot cause if you add cold water here the temperature of the gravy will go low. And the chicken may go tough, so it's very important to add hot water to any Curry. So let's mix this. Well, yeah, that's perfect.

Alright, now, last but certainly not least, my favorite ingredient in this marinade, and that's fresh Asian pear now. If you don't have access to Asian pear, just a regular Bosch pear would work. I mean, even probably can pears in a pinch, but this just makes this recipe is a nice clean, crisp, slightly sweet."}]

I personally ask for it to be custom anyway, I just like it a little bit thicker than the ribs that there selling and one little tip. What I like to do before I prepare these.

And I'd like to get all that off before I put this in a marinade. Alright, let's get these things in a marinade. Alright, so pretty basic stuff. We're going to take the container personally.

Now I'm going to go ahead and start flipping these. Smells really, really good. This one little close to the hot coals, so maybe well done. These other guys are looking really good.
